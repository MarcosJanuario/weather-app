# Marcos Weather App with Angular
Welcome to Marcos Weather App, a showcase of key Angular framework concepts and best practices..

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in various Angular topics, highlighting the application of essential concepts for building robust and scalable web applications. While the UI serves the purpose of a Weather App, the emphasis here is on showcasing my Angular capabilities.

## Key Angular Concepts Covered
* **Lazy Loading:** Optimizing application performance through lazy loading of modules.
* **State Management:** Effective state management using @ngrx/store for handling complex data flow and application state.
* **Translation:** Implementing internationalization and localization using @ngx-translate/core for a multilingual application.
* **HTTP Client:** Utilizing Angular's HttpClient module for efficient handling of HTTP requests and communication with external APIs.
* **RxJS:** Leveraging reactive programming principles with RxJS to manage asynchronous operations and handle data streams efficiently.
* **Services:** Utilizing Angular services to encapsulate business logic and facilitate data communication.
* **Custom Attribute Directives:** Creating and applying custom attribute directives to enhance the functionality of HTML elements.
* **Angular Animation:** Incorporating Angular animations to provide a dynamic and engaging user experience.
